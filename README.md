# baselayer
This project was created to help a runner choose what baselayer to wear depending on the number of miles they will be running and what the weather is.  The baselayer.csv file can be customized to reflect specific groupings of clothes in one's closet. City Id can also be customized using city ids from Open Weather Map API.  A few features were added such as modes of transportation.
